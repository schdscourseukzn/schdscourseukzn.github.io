```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(pdftools)
library(stringr)

```

In this lab we'll be learning more about string processing using `stringr`, and `pdftools`. You'll also need the packages `lubridate`, `tidyverse`, and `dplyr`.

### Problem 1: Birthdays

For Problem 1 we are given a vector of birthdays. We want to convert these into ages, using today's date as the reference point.

```{r}
birthday <- c("September 1, 1955", 
                 "06/21/1970",
                 "1992 July 17th",
                 "june 6 1980",
                 "1/4/1995",
                 "7/1/94",
                 "06/03/1992",
                 "7/28/00",
                 "1990/09/22",
                 "January 2, 1990",
                 "February22nd,  '98",
                 "June 3, 1982", 
                 "08-2-1999",
                 "2000-7-4")
```


#### Part (a)

There are issues with the data we are given - what are they?


#### Part (b)

Let's start cleaning this up - first let's decide the format that would be easiest to work with. 

The package `lubridate` can help us with this. I provided code below to calculate age using my birthday.

```{r}
refDate <- Sys.Date()
birthDate <- "1994-06-27"
time_length(difftime(refDate, birthDate), "years")
```

Here I used `YYYY-MM-DD` for my birthday, but there are other options in `lubridate`. We will stick with `YYYY-MM-DD` to simplify things. Let's start with the "easier" cases and go from there.

The first step is to find all dates of the form `MM/DD/YYYY`, `MM/DD/YY`, `MM-DD-YYYY`, etc. and create a new `data.frame` with 4 columns: `id`, `month`, `day`, and `year`. We'll do this together:

```{r}
ages <- data.frame(id=1:length(birthday),dob=birthday)
pattern1 <- "^(([1-9])|(0[1-9])|(1[0-2]))(/|-)\\d{1,2}(/|-)(\\d{2}|\\d{4})$"

ages1 <- ages %>% filter(str_detect(dob, pattern1)) %>%
  separate(dob, c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/|-") %>%
  mutate_at(c("day","month"),str_remove, pattern="^0+") 

ages_left <- ages %>% filter(!str_detect(dob, pattern1)) 
ages_left
```

Let's decode `pattern1`:

- `^` = start of string
- `|` = "or" operand 
- `()` captures groupings, i.e. `A(nt)|(pple)` will match Ant or Apple
- `(([1-9])|(0[1-9])|(1[0-2]))` = 1-9 or 01-09 or 10-12 (for month)
- `(/|-)` = / or -
- `\\d{1,2}` = one or two digits digit (for day)
- `\\d{2}|\\d{4}` = two or four digits (for year)
- `$` = end of string
- `+` = one or more

Next find the dates in numeric format with year first, and add those to `ages1`.

```{r}
#pattern2 <- 


```


#### Part (c)

Now let's deal with the remaining cases. In all of them, month is spelled out (some with first letter capitalized, some without). In every entry, date immediately follows month. Year is sometimes first and sometimes last, with either 2 or 4 digits. Since day can only take values in 1-31, and two-digit years only take values in 50-98 (see `ages_left`) we can easily differentiate between 2 digit days and 2 digit years.

Try this out using the function `str_extract` and three different `patterns` for month, day, and year. You should be able to catch all the remaining entries.

```{r}
# pattern_month <-
# pattern_year <-
# pattern_day <-


```


#### Part (d)

Our parsed data is almost ready! We just have to fix a few last issues. For this problem, please fix the following:

1. The years that are 2 digits need to be 4 digits
2. All months need to be in numeric format
3. All single digits need to have a "0" in front

*Hint*: for each of `year`,`month`,`day` create a parse function which takes as input one string and converts it to the proper format. Then use `sapply` to apply it over every element in the `data.frame`. For example, `sapply(year, year_parse)`.

Next, add a new entry to your `data.frame` called dob. This should have the individual's birthday in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format so we can easily call the `compute_age` function below. You can do this using `paste(year,"-", month, "-", day, sep="")`.

```{r}
compute_age <- function(dob) {
  refDate = Sys.Date()
  return(time_length(difftime(refDate, dob), "years"))
}
```

```{r}
months <- c("january","february","march","april","may","june","july",
           "august","september","october","november", "december")

# Easier way to get months
#months <- tolower(month.name)


```


### Problem 2: Weight

For this problem, you are given a vector of user-generated weights in pounds and kilograms. Convert this vector into a `data.frame` with three columns: `weight_original`, `weight_kg`, `weight_lbs`. Recall that 1 kg = 2.2046 lbs.

```{r}
weight <- c("55 kg", 
            "130 lbs",
            "150 pounds",
            "77 kilogram",
            "84kg", 
            "150 lb",
            "124 pound",
            "60 kg", 
            "70 kg")
```

```{r}
weights <- data.frame(weight=weight)

# pattern_lb <-

# pattern_kg <- 
```
